# Advent-of-Code
This repository houses all of my code I used to solved [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

I discovered Advent of Code in 2020 and learned a lot by working through the challenges.
I decided to start working through prior years and will continue to do so (at a varying pace).
